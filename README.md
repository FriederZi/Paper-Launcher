# Paper Launcher

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OhMyLob/Paper-Launcher/master/art/video.gif)
<br>
This is an Android Launcher app based on Eduardo Pratti's mockup and made from scratch.
<br>
The Launcher is only tested on my device (Nexus 5X running Android Oreo 8.0), but should work on <b>every</b> Android Jelly Bean 4.3 phone.
<br>
The launcher includes basically 0 customization, you can only change wallpaper and the dock icons, as it's only been an experiment to me, trying to do my best with smooth <b>animation</b> and <b>transitions</b>, bringing a new <b>modern</b> look to my phone.
<br>
The second dock that appears when you slide on the first dock or open the App drawer is <b>dynamic</b> and brings your <b>most launched apps</b> always visible.
<br>
The app includes <b>Homescreen gestures</b>, swipe up to open the App drawer, swipe down to expand the StatusBar
<br>
Android Nougat 7.1 <b>Shortcuts</b> are supported with a new layout that uses the Material BottomSheet component.
<br>
All the design part is made by <b>Eduardo Pratti</b>, thank you Eduardo!
